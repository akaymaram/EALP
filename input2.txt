To avoid stasis, men have to speak with one voice. But merely an agreement to speak in unison is not enough. A group of individuals each agreeing to have the same opinion and to speak identical words is not speaking as the People, rather as a multitude of people. And since a loose association of a multitude of people can not trust each other to keep their promises, such an organization is not sustainable and does not achieve the purpose of avoiding stasis. Therefore, Hobbes suggests that simply making agreements is not sufficient. Rather, in their natural instinct to avoid death, people mutually agree with each other to relinquish and transfer certain rights to a Voice that will speak for them. The Voice resembles the Sovereign in Hobbes, regardless of its physical form or organization. And reverting to the second condition of stasis, that the set of philosophies in question can not be a trivial opinion -- these non-trivial philosophies, according to Hobbes, are the definitions of Good and Evil, Just and Unjust. Therefore, as the single Voice, a sovereignâ€™s words are the clear and distinct definition of Good and Evil, Just and Unjust. Such definition with regards to future actions are made available to the public and enforced through penalties, and is understood to be the civil law.
